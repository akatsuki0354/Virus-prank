# Virus Prank

This app is for prank purposes only. I used for loops in the code to repeatedly display warnings, creating the appearance of a virus.

## How to use:

```
git clone https://github.com/akatsuki0354/Virus-prank

PyInstaller --onefile --windowed --icon=virus.ico main.py

pyinstaller --onefile --windowed main.py
```
